Problem 05_04_Brackets
Write a program which reads a single line from the console, containing brackets for a mathematical expression 
(only the brackets will appear in the input), and determines whether the brackets in the expression are correct. 
There are 3 types of brackets – {}, [] and (). {} can contain {}, [] and () brackets. 
Square brackets [] can contain [] and () brackets. Curved () brackets can contain only () brackets. 
Said simply, each type of brackets can contain the same type of brackets inside, or 
a “lower” type of brackets (() is lower than [] which is lower than {}). If a bracket of one type is opened, 
it needs to be closed before a bracket of another type is closed.
Print valid if the brackets in the expression are valid and invalid if they are not.

Examples
Input01	
[()]{}{[()()]()}
Output:	valid

Input02
[(])	
Output: invalid

Input03:
([])	
Output: invalid

Input04:
()[[[()]]]{[()]}
Output:	valid

Input05:
{{{[[[((()))()()()]]]}}}
Output: valid

Input06:
{
Output: invalid

Input07:
)
Output: invalid
